## What the heck is alonetone?

alonetone is a place for small label, DIY, bedroom and other musicians and bands to upload and share their mp3s for free. We've been around since 2008.

If you make music (and own the rights to it) then this site is built for you.


## So, it's free?

Yup!


## Why alonetone instead of cool service XYZ?

Most other 'free' services where you can host your music run ads, are funded by investors hoping to eventually flip the service or flat out owned by media conglomerates. In general, they are hoping to make money off of your "content"...erm...music.

alonetone was started to provide a non-commercial alternative. Something that musicians can feel like they own.

Beyond that, we want to do it right. Clean, only the essentials. Not too dorked-out. Easy to get around. [Read more here](/about/why-i-built-alonetone).


## Who pays for all of this? Are you a startup?

We are supported by fellow alonetoners and caring people like yourself over on [patreon](http://patreon.com/alonetone)!

## So who makes alonetone?

alonetone is conceived and built by [Sudara](/sudara).

[montgomeru](/montgomeru) handles frontend coding.

We get regular design love from Samo.

After our initial launch in 2008, most features were inspired, recommended by, and built to please alonetoners who spoke up and provided their valuable feedback in chat and the forums.


## How long will it be free?

We strongly believe there should be more free, non-commercial places to share music online. Therefore, the ability to upload and share music without ads or payment will exist as long as alonetone exists.

You can help us realize this vision over on [patreon](http://patreon.com/alonetone)!

## Is alonetone open source?

Yup! We are open-minded to contributions at [github](http://github.com/sudara/alonetone).

Thanks to the nice people at [BrowserStack](https://browserstack.com) and [Skylight](https://skylight.io) for providing their services free for open source projects.
